# Statistical Methods III - Final Project - Relationship Between Happiness and Alcohol

Based on the [Kaggle Happiness and Alcohol Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marcospessotto/happiness-and-alcohol-consumption?resource=download), this was the final project for stat methods 3. In this analysis, we attempt to create a regression model which aims to see if there is a multivariate relationship between countries with higher alcohol consumption and their assigned happiness score.
